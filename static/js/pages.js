It penalises larger errors more heavily, so lower bars indicate a model that is both accurate and stable. Compare models directly: the shortest bar has the best overall fit in terms of RMS deviation.</p></br /><div class="chart" id="chart-rmse"></div></div> <div class="card"><h3>MAE by Model</h3><br /><p><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</strong> — This chart displays the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values. It treats all errors linearly (no extra penalty for big misses), making it easy to interpret in the original units (°C). Lower is better; the lowest bar is the most consistently accurate model.</p></br /><div class="chart" id="chart-mae"></div></div>              <div class="card"><h3>R² by Model</h3><br /><p><strong>Coefficient of Determination (R²)</strong> — This chart indicates how much variance in the actual data is explained by the model (from 0 to 1, sometimes negative if the model performs worse than a constant mean). Higher is better; taller bars mean the model captures more of the temperature dynamics.</p></br /><div class="chart" id="chart-r2"></div></div>              <div class="card"><h3>MAPE (%) by Model</h3><br /><p><strong>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</strong> — This chart shows the average error as a percentage of the actual value, providing a unitless, scale-free metric that’s easy to compare across datasets. Lower is better; shorter bars reflect smaller typical percentage errors across the forecast horizon.</p></br /><div class="chart" id="chart-mape_pct"></div></div>'
